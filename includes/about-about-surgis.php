        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>SurGIS of Texas Corporation is a woman-owned state certified land surveying HUB located in Helotes, TX, right outside of loop 1604. It was founded in 2012 by 
            Lydia McCloskey (President) and her husband Philip Hampton (Vice-President, Lead RPLS) because they felt many organizations out there looked at surveying as an add-on or a lost leader to their Engineering department rather than making the Survey a priority. Those types of organizations don't understand that customers enjoy a 
            company that deals with their survey, whatever the type, as if it is the foundation of their project. Treating Surveying in this manner lends itself to bad practices. Surveying is an art and is the oldest profession in 
            the world - why would you treat it like a second class division?</p>

        <p>This is why SurGIS of Texas has such focus on bringing integrity back to land surveying. Every survey we complete is done with the understanding that this is 
            the foundation of our clients project. Everything done afterwards, whether it be transferring a land title, putting in a new well or building a courthouse is 
            reliant upon the information in our survey being accurate. With over 45 years of land surveying experience, and having served hundreds of clients, both 
            private and government entities, all across Texas, we understand the need for accuracy and integrity in our work and we ensure it guides us in every decision 
            we make.</p>
