        <p>SurGIS of Texas Corporation is a woman-owned land surveying HUB located in Helotes, TX, right outside of loop 1604. SurGIS was founded in 2012 by 
        Lydia McCloskey (President) and her husband Philip Hampton (Vice-President and Lead RPLS) with the intention of bringing one of the most important 
        values a company can have back to land surveying: Integrity. Backed by over 45 years of surveying experience, Lydia and Philip built SurGIS from the 
        ground up and have conducted surveys all across Texas for hundreds of clients, including the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT), Teal 
        Construction, 6S Engineering, the City of Tilden and more. We cover most survey types, such as Tree and Location, As-Builts, Topographic, Boundary 
        and Subdivision, Construction Staking, ALTA & TSPS, FEMA Flood Certificates, Right of Way Expansions and more.</p>
